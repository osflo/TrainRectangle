# Bachelor Semester Project : The stabbing problem
This repository contains the code for my semester project at EPFL with the DISOPT chair under the supervision of Martina Gallato. 

## Introduction
The horizontal stabbing problem consists in finding a set of horizontal segments of minimal length that stabs a given set of n axis-aligned rectangles such that each segment starts and ends at the extremity of one or multiple rectangles. The algorithm implemented here give an 8-approximation algorithm for this problem in O(n<sup>4</sup>). This algorithm was first described in Eisenbrand et al. (2021).

## Usage

### Librairies
The libraries math, copy, igraph, numpy, matplotlib, random, time and gurobipy are needed to run all the files.  
A gurobi licence might be necessary to have the optimal solution for big instances.

### Files and folders
*ClassRectangle.py* : The main class defining the rectangle that are stabbed.   

*Dpfonction.py* :  The main parts of the algorithm.  

*approxi_particular exemple* : This file return a figure with 3 subfigures corresponding to the optimal solution, the final solution given by our algorithm and the solution on the laminar instance given by the dynamic program on a given example.  

*laminar_graph.py* : Create a laminar instance of the problem : A set of axis-aligned rectangles is laminar if, for any pair of rectangles in it, their projection on the x-axis are either disjoint or one is contained in the other.  

*main.py* : Create a given or random example of an instance of the problem, run the algorithm and plot the result.  

*test_approximation.py* : Apply the algorithm on a multitude of random cases and save the interesting results. This was done with the goal of empirically testing the approximation.  

*test_complexity.py* : Apply the algorithm and register the time to run it for different axis size and number of rectangle. This was done in order to empirically test the complexity.

*figures and ratio* : Folder containing figures and results created by the algorithm. The folder is then further divided by the advancement in the project.

*test debug and presentation* : Folder containing scripts used to debug and analyze results. To use the script, the path name to the result files need to be updated.
