The libraries math, copy, igraph, numpy, matplotlib, random, time and gurobipy are needed to run all the files.
A gurobi licence might be necessary to have the optimal solution for big instances. The files concerned are approx_particular.py example and test_approximation.py.
DPfonction depends on ClassRectangle and all the main files depends on ClassRectangle and DPfonction.
In test debug and presentation, the before.py and final average.py files need the text files that they read to be on the same folder as them (or to change the path name).
Only limit_ratio.py and test_time.py in this foolder depend on ClassRectangle and Dpfonction.
