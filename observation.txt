problem : when xh is little bigger than a multiple of 2 for one rectangle and xb a little smaller than a power of 2 for the other one
, in the worst case scenario the laminar rectangle will not intersect at all the true one
which can provock inside rectangle to not be inside anymore if not the same lower 2^

little bit smaller than power of 2 => move completly on the left
little bit bigger than multiple of 2 => almost 2* more large than necessary
why adding one rectangle lower the ratio ? 

for big ratio w must be 2^k+1 and located such that first multiple is far on the left for one buton the right for the other one 
two rectangle must not have the same first multiple in commun thus if same lenght on bothe side of thismultiple

work well when laminar leave superposed one superposed even if w is power of 2

always max 10, rect inferior to 20, need balance so not too long, small n<=10,x,y<40 bcs of speed a lot more small cases
try to put w=2^k+1 => not more extreme but mediane higher

erreur les coordonnées écrites sont celle de l'instance laminar ....

for case 2 : moving a bit 
case 3 : for the rectangle inside, moving xh doesn't change anything as long as inside,outside diminish the rate ,removing extra rectangle that are good make the rate higher
need for the two rectangle to not have the same multiple in commun, not have even lenght and the xh in the inside rectangle must be between 2^k+1 and xh of outside rectangle
if not the *2 is not so much more

After modif the biggest problem is when one rectangle is cut multiple times
